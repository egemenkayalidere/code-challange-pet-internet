Note: 

This project has been created by using React Native Ignite Framework. It is chosed since it is more intelligent than common project creation methods "create-react-native-app or react-native init" commands. In this project, redux is exist, but it was not used any state management since this project is not big.
Native-Base UI Library was used to handle UI management.
"React Navigation Library" was used to handle navigation between screens.
